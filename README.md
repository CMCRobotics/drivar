It comes with :

* A low-level Python abstraction library
* Various concrete implementations (Pimoroni Explorer HAT, Push-pull drivers, Adafruit DC Motor, Lego Mindstorm)
* (in preparation) a simple Web Socket and REST API implementation for control over the network
* (in preparation) A Jupyter Notebook setup example, showing you how to control cars interactively
* (in preparation) A Webjar package providing Google Blockly block definitions for Python scripts generation.

Drivar is used by :

* The [Raspbuggy project](http://cmcrobotics.github.io/raspbuggy)
* The [GianoPi project](http://github.com/stefsaladino/GianoPi)
